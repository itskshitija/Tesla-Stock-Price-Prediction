## 🎯Objective
This project aims to analyze the Tesla stock price dataset by performing detailed <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b> and developing robust forecasting models to predict future stock trends. This can provide valuable insights for investors and stakeholders.

## 🌟Project Flow
- <b>Data Ingestion: </b> Loading the dataset and checking its integrity.
- <b>Exploratory Data Analysis: </b> Understanding patterns, seasonality, and trends in stock prices.
- <b>Data Transformation: </b> Preprocessing the data for model readiness (e.g., scaling, differencing).
- <b>Model Building: </b> Constructing and training forecasting models.
- <b>Analysis: </b> Evaluating model performance and visualizing predictions.

## 🔢Models Used
We leverage the following time-series forecasting models:
<b>ARIMA:</b>  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
<b>SARIMA:</b> Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
